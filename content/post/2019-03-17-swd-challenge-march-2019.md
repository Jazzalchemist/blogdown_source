After a hiatus of a few months I'm back into taking part in the #SWDChallenge! 

March's challenge was a collaboration between Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic (Storytelling with Data) and Enrico Bertini (Data Stories podcast). The aim was to visualise a predefined data set and answer the question of 'who donates?'.

#### The Data
The dataset came from [AidData](https://www.aiddata.org/data/aiddata-core-research-release-level-1-3-1)

#### My Approach
* Create a one page report that addressed the question
* Zero in on the highest donators and take a look at how they were contributing

#### Reflections
##### What worked well?
* I managed to pull something together by the deadline!
* The design works well in answering the question

##### What could be improved?
* I had the intention of creating a one page report that could be either interactive or viewed as a static report. The interactivity didn't go as well as I had hoped. If I had started the challenge earlier then it is possible that I would have achieved this
* I needed to dig a little deeper in my analysis (also impacted by the late start to the challenge)
