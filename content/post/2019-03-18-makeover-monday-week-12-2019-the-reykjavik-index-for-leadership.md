Week 12 of #MakeoverMonday looked at the Reykjavik Index Index. Here's the original visualisation:

#### What works well:
- Simple colour scheme
- It is possible to figure see which countries are above average

#### What could be improved:
- Being a radial chart, it's circular nature makes it much harder to read than a bar chart
- The chart lacks context for what it is trying to show
- The G7 average gets a bit lost amongst the countries, despite being a different colour

#### What I focused on:
- I wanted to show the data in a bar chart that had supporting commentary. I tried messing with radial charts and lollipop charts, but the good ol' bar chart made the most sense to use.
