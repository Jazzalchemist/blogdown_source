This week I’ve found myself in an all-too familiar trap. It started off with a client asking for a mock-up of a dashboard to be done ASAP. Now, I knew this task was looming on the horizon, but I had been putting it off mainly because I was helping the client with something else arguably more important.

Just to clarify, I had already talked to the client about putting off working on the dashboard due to the high priority task.

I was playing catch-up with other work entirely when the client contacted me. He asked for the dashboard to be done for a meeting this week. It was a last-minute request which would mean reshuffling my workload for the week, so I initially said no. The point at which I caved was when the client started explaining the importance of the meeting. He also mentioned I had previously agreed to do the work. 

Was it my fault he had left the request to the last minute? No. Did I feel responsible for getting the work done in time for the meeting? Hell yes.

So, this is when the whole self-reflection thing comes in.

What I should have done is firmly – but politely – say no to the request due to the impact it would have on other prioritized work and therefore other clients. The next step would have been to offer an alternative (e.g. find someone else to do it or negotiate the deadline) to show that I’ve put thought into solving the problem.

Even though I’ve handled similar situations numerous times in the past, I sometimes forget how difficult it can be to say no.
