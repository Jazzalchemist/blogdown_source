Hey there! It's been awhile.

Habits are interesting things. Good habits take awhile to form, but can be incredibly beneficial. I like forming good habits, but over the previous 11 months I've noticed how easy it is to break a habit - namely, blogging.

I started blogging back in November 2017 to get back into writing in a way that I actually enjoy, and to force myself to write about what I'm learning.

I started with a couple of posts about different functions in Excel, and from there I ventured into self-reflective posts and book reviews. The big thing to come out of blogging was that I enjoyed it. It also cemented what I was learning. 

But then I stopped.

The major reason for this was a simple but powerful one - my job in the public sector was horrible. I fell into the trap of doing more hours to try and stay afloat with a heavy workload. I was in a turbulent sea of analytics and reporting. 

It sucked. I hated it. I started looking for a new role. 

So in early 2018 I started looking for a new role. I found one in a small organisation that deals with consumer spending data. I said to myself that at this point I would start blogging again. Then something else happened, I started studying again. 

For context, I'm working on a degree majoring in Computer Science and Statistics. It's proving to be a challenging degree to pick up part-time whilst holding down a full-time role. I'm enjoying it though, but it was proving difficult to find time to blog. Once again, I put it off. 

Here I am though. About to get back into blogging before I start studying in the new year. I want to use this blog to write about my journey as a student, and to hopefully help others in the process, so the challenge will be trying to find a balance. 

In the meantime I'll start writing about the portfolio I'm currently putting together, as well as the fun experiences I've had learning Tableau. I'll start adding posts about some of the code I've been using at work too. 

Anyway, that's about it for now. I'll add a new post in the next few days about my first Tableau viz.
