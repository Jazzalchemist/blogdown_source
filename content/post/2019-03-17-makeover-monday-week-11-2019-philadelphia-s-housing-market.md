I've finally started taking part in the #Makeover Monday challenge! Week 11 looked at real estate transfers in Philadelphia. Here's the original visualisation:

### What works well:
- Clean area chart is easy to read
- Simple colour scheme
- Sorted bar chart

### What could be improved:
- The bar chart needs to be resized
- The map lacks detail
- The titles aren't very helpful

### What I focused on
- As it was my first week, I thought I'd try and focus on clean design. I decided to add more detail to the area chart to try and show what the high/low points meant
