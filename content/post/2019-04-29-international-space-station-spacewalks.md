Week 18 of #MakeoverMonday looked at spacewalks at the International Space Station. 

Here's the original viz:

#### What works well:
- The heading is a succinct summary of what the viz is showing
- Using the BANS (Big-ass numbers) for USA and Russia as a legend is a good idea
- The labels on the bars make the chart easier to read
- The colours are a good choice as they are very close to the NASA palette

#### What could be improved:
- The years on the x-axis are on an angle, making them harder to read
- There are numerous images on the viz, making it very busy

#### What I focused on:
- Changing the bar chart to a line chart
- Changing the orientation of the dates on the x-axis to be horizontal
- Adding the BANs into the description
