      <description>It has been a tough few months in the lead up to Christmas.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found my motivation to do, well, anything in data visualisation has severely waned. As a result, I took steps to try and reinvigorate my interest in what I was doing. For example, I started learning Tableau in late July, and shortly after began to post to things to my Tableau Public profile. I even started taking part in the #SWDchallenge.</description>

      <description>Hey there! It&amp;rsquo;s been awhile.
Habits are interesting things. Good habits take awhile to form, but can be incredibly beneficial. I like forming good habits, but over the previous 11 months I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed how easy it is to break a habit - namely, blogging.
I started blogging back in November 2017 to get back into writing in a way that I actually enjoy, and to force myself to write about what I&amp;rsquo;m learning.</description>
