Week 14 of #MakeoverMonday looked at the different types of waste found on UK beaches per 100m. The data comes from a 2017 by the Marine Conservation Society. Here's the original visualisation:

#### What works well:
- Clean layout with minimal colours
- Clear title and subtitle
- The icons help improve the design

#### What could be improved:
- The scattered circles make it hard to compare each category
- What's the bigger story behind this viz? Is this an improve on the previous period? Is it worse?

#### What I focused on:
- I added context to the begining of the viz by referencing the average pieces of waste found per 100m. I also added this was a worse result than the previous year
- I also checked the original report and found that the data actually refers to the top ten waste items found per 100m. I labelled my bar chart accordingly 
- I highlighted the amount of plastic that was found per 100m. This was a very scary thing to see
