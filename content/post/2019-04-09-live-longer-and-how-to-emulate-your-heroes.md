This month's [#SWDChallenge](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2019/4/1/swdchallenge-emulate) was to find to a visualisation you like and emulate it. I went with the ['Live Long' chart](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/what-could-really-increase-life-expectancy-lifespan-and-longevity/) by David McCandless of Information is Beautiful. I'm a big fan of David's work. The design choices he applies to his charts is stunning. I even own two of his books - Information is Beautiful and Knowledge is Beautiful - which I love to flick through when I'm struggling for inspiration. 

I decided to emulate the 'Live Long' chart because a) I wanted to make an interactive version in Tableau, and b) I saw how I could apply my own style to it. Here's the original chart:

And my version of it:

#### Reflections
##### What worked well?
* In my version I removed the comments in the original viz and added them into the tooltips. This made for a cleaner layout
* I was happy with the overall design, which didn't look like a blatant copy of the original viz!

##### What could be improved?
* In hindsight, I should've added some sort of conclusion to my viz. The original did this well by adding a final bar to the chart that outlined a 'recipe' for living longer
