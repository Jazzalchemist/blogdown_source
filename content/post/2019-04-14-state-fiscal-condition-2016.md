Week 15 of #MakeoverMonday looked at ranking US states by fiscal condition. Here's the original visualisation:

#### What works well:
- Tidy design
- Good choice of colours
- Clear question in the title
- The top/bottom states are clearly stated

#### What could be improved:
- It isn't clear if things are improving or getting worse. Is this any different to the previous year?
- More information could be added in the form of text to help explain what is being shown here

#### What I focused on:
- I struggled with this one. After taking some inspiration from Charlie Hutcheson's [viz](https://public.tableau.com/profile/charlie.hutcheson#!/vizhome/MMStateFiscalCondition/Dashboard1) for this week, he was kind enough to help me improve my map through suggesting I follow a [hex map tutorial](https://vizpainter.com/hex-map-spatial-file/) by Joshua Milligan. I then focussed on adding interactivity in the form of being able to fitle results per state.
- I liked the top/bottom states shown in the original viz, So I kept them in my version. I also highlighted each of the top and bottom states in my hex map.
