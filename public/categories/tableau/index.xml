      <description>Week 20 of #MakeoverMonday looked at a very sad topic - rhino poachng in South Africa.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the original viz:
What works well:  Simple but effective colours choices Clear title The use of rhino imagery helps make it immediately clear what the chart is about  What could be improved:  I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the use of a unit chart as it didn&amp;rsquo;t quite make sense in terms of numbers of poached rhinos per year The use of rhino icons seemed a but too &amp;lsquo;fun&amp;rsquo; for such a serious topic  What I focused on:  I wanted to simplify the orginal chart I wanted to annotate some of the key facts as well  The interactive version can be found here</description>

      <description>Week 19 of #MakeoverMonday looked at the most efficient batters in Major League Baseball (MLB).
Here&amp;rsquo;s the original viz:
What works well:  Simple title that says what it is about Nice colour choices There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of detail included, but without cluttering the viz  What could be improved:  I don&amp;rsquo;t follow baseball, I was a bit lost when trying to understand this I was confused by the highlighted stats.</description>

      <description>The focus of this month&amp;rsquo;s #SWDChallenge was on artisanal data.
I found this challenge to be incredibly enjoyable. Why? Because I got to design a visualisation using data that I knew inside and out (since it was about my work history after all!). But hey, that was kinda the point, right?
I want to take a step back here though. I want to address why I used data about my work history.</description>

      <description>Week 18 of #MakeoverMonday looked at spacewalks at the International Space Station.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the original viz:
What works well:  The heading is a succinct summary of what the viz is showing Using the BANS (Big-ass numbers) for USA and Russia as a legend is a good idea The labels on the bars make the chart easier to read The colours are a good choice as they are very close to the NASA palette  What could be improved:  The years on the x-axis are on an angle, making them harder to read There are numerous images on the viz, making it very busy  What I focused on:  Changing the bar chart to a line chart Changing the orientation of the dates on the x-axis to be horizontal Adding the BANs into the description  The interactive version can be found here</description>

      <description>Week 17 of #MakeoverMonday looked at Stephen Curry&amp;rsquo;s ranking of stadium popcorn.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the original viz:
What works well:  A heat chart is perfect for this data. The labels and colours work well There&amp;rsquo;s a clear title The scoring is simple  What could be improved:  The colours aren&amp;rsquo;t great  What I focused on:  Although I do like the original chart, I decided to try something different.</description>

      <description>Week 16 of #MakeoverMonday was a collaboration with RJ Andrews, and looked at the most common words in his book Info We Trust.
What works well:  The most common word, data, stands out well People are used to seeing and interpreting word clouds  What could be improved:  Lack of a title or description Having words on different angles makes them hard to read Too many colours that don&amp;rsquo;t seem to serve a purpose  What I focused on:  I decided to show the top ten words per section in the book, which highlighted how common the word &amp;lsquo;data&amp;rsquo; is.</description>

      <description>Week 15 of #MakeoverMonday looked at ranking US states by fiscal condition. Here&amp;rsquo;s the original visualisation:
What works well:  Tidy design Good choice of colours Clear question in the title The top/bottom states are clearly stated  What could be improved:  It isn&amp;rsquo;t clear if things are improving or getting worse. Is this any different to the previous year? More information could be added in the form of text to help explain what is being shown here  What I focused on:  I struggled with this one.</description>

      <title>Live Longer and How to Emulate Your Heroes</title>
      <link>https://jaredbraggins.com/2019/04/live-longer-and-how-to-emulate-your-heroes/</link>

      <guid>https://jaredbraggins.com/2019/04/live-longer-and-how-to-emulate-your-heroes/</guid>
      <description>This month&amp;rsquo;s #SWDChallenge was to find a visualisation you like and emulate it. I went with the &amp;lsquo;Live Long&amp;rsquo; chart by David McCandless of Information is Beautiful. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of David&amp;rsquo;s work. His visualisations are stunning. I even own two of his books - Information is Beautiful and Knowledge is Beautiful - which I love to flick through when I&amp;rsquo;m struggling for inspiration.
I decided to emulate the &amp;lsquo;Live Long&amp;rsquo; chart because a) I wanted to make an interactive version in Tableau, and b) I saw how I could apply my own style to it.</description>

      <title>What Kind of Waste Appeared on UK Beaches in 2017?</title>

      <description>Week 14 of #MakeoverMonday looked at the different types of waste found on UK beaches per 100m. The data comes from a 2017 by the Marine Conservation Society. Here&amp;rsquo;s the original visualisation:
What works well:  Clean layout with minimal colours Clear title and subtitle The icons help improve the design  What could be improved:  The scattered circles make it hard to compare each category What&amp;rsquo;s the bigger story behind this viz?</description>

      <description>Week 13 of #MakeoverMonday looked at how different generations are spending their income. Here&amp;rsquo;s the original visualisation:
What works well:  The overall layout is simple and uncluttered Vivid colours help make each category stand out  What could be improved:  The legend could be moved to the top to help make reading the chart easier Each portion of each bar doesn&amp;rsquo;t start from the same place, so it tricky to compare across each age group (although the labels do help with this)  What I focused on:  I simplified the original visualisation by separating each age group and category into separate bar charts.</description>

      <description>Week 12 of #MakeoverMonday looked at the Reykjavik Index Index. Here&amp;rsquo;s the original visualisation:
What works well:  Simple colour scheme It is possible to figure see which countries are above average  What could be improved:  Being a radial chart, it&amp;rsquo;s circular nature makes it much harder to read than a bar chart The chart lacks context for what it is trying to show The G7 average gets a bit lost amongst the countries, despite being a different colour  What I focused on:  I wanted to show the data in a bar chart that had supporting commentary.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally started taking part in the #MakeoverMonday challenge! Week 11 looked at real estate transfers in Philadelphia. Here&amp;rsquo;s the original visualisation:
What works well:  Clean area chart is easy to read Simple colour scheme Sorted bar chart  What could be improved:  The bar chart needs to be resized The map lacks detail The titles aren&amp;rsquo;t very helpful  What I focused on:  As it was my first week, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try and focus on clean design.</description>

      <description>After a hiatus of a few months I&amp;rsquo;m back into taking part in the #SWDChallenge!
March&amp;rsquo;s challenge was a collaboration between Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic (Storytelling with Data) and Enrico Bertini (Data Stories podcast). The aim was to visualise a predefined data set and answer the question of &amp;lsquo;who donates?&amp;rsquo;.
The Data The dataset came from AidData
My Approach  Create a one page report that addressed the question Zero in on the highest donators and take a look at how they were contributing  Reflections What worked well?</description>
