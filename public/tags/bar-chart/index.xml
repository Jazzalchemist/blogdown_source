      <description>Week 20 of #MakeoverMonday looked at a very sad topic - rhino poachng in South Africa.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the original viz:
What works well:  Simple but effective colours choices Clear title The use of rhino imagery helps make it immediately clear what the chart is about  What could be improved:  I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the use of a unit chart as it didn&amp;rsquo;t quite make sense in terms of numbers of poached rhinos per year The use of rhino icons seemed a but too &amp;lsquo;fun&amp;rsquo; for such a serious topic  What I focused on:  I wanted to simplify the orginal chart I wanted to annotate some of the key facts as well  The interactive version can be found here</description>

      <description>Week 19 of #MakeoverMonday looked at the most efficient batters in Major League Baseball (MLB).
Here&amp;rsquo;s the original viz:
What works well:  Simple title that says what it is about Nice colour choices There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of detail included, but without cluttering the viz  What could be improved:  I don&amp;rsquo;t follow baseball, I was a bit lost when trying to understand this I was confused by the highlighted stats.</description>
