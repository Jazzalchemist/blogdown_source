Hi there!

First and foremost, welcome to my blog.

This is something that I have wanted to do for a while now, but I always seemed to put it off. 
I've decided to step into the wondrous world of blogging for a few reasons:

1. I enjoy the process of writing, and I have recently missed this creative outlet

2. I've been reading and learning from numerous analytics bloggers for the past three years. I thought I'd throw my hat in the ring and see if I can give a little back

3. The process of blogging will ensure that I keep the momentum up for learning new things

Beyond interesting things happening in the analytics community, expect to see posts about coding, craft beer, basketball and general analytics geekery. 

Thanks, and feel free to leave a comment!
