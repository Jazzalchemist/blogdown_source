      <description>#TidyTuesday Week 14 was a good challenge for me. I wanted to focus on getting better at creating line charts with ggplot2, and I feel like I achieved that goal.
The Data Week 14&amp;rsquo;s data comes from Seattle&amp;rsquo;s open data portal and contains information about bike traffic in Seattle.
The Analysis SInce I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to get back up to speed with using R, I decided to keep it simple and focus on a) showing traffic over time, and b) showing which crossing registered the most traffic each year.</description>

      <description>My second week taking part in #TidyTuesday! Let&amp;rsquo;s keep the ball rolling&amp;hellip;
The Data The data for week 12 was all about traffic stops made by US police officers, which comes from the Stanford Open Policing Project
Analysis I wanted to continue focusing on refreshing my ggplot2 skills this week, particularly around the use of using facet_wrap(). My approach to the analysis was to have a look at driver race in terms of number of traffic stops.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started taking part in #TidyTuesday, a weekly project focused on using tidyverse packages to clean, wrangle, tidy, and plot a new dataset. The big draw card for me is getting better at using R for analysis.
The Data The data for week 11 was all about board games, which comes from the Board Game Geek Database
Analysis I kept it very simple this week. This was mainly due to my R skills slipping over the previous year.</description>
