      <description>The focus of this month&amp;rsquo;s #SWDChallenge was on artisanal data.
I found this challenge to be incredibly enjoyable. Why? Because I got to design a visualisation using data that I knew inside and out (since it was about my work history after all!). But hey, that was kinda the point, right?
I want to take a step back here though. I want to address why I used data about my work history.</description>
