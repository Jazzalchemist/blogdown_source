Week 17 of #MakeoverMonday looked at Stephen Curry's ranking of stadium popcorn.

Here's the original viz:

#### What works well:
- A heat chart is perfect for this data. The labels and colours work well
- There's a clear title
- The scoring is simple

#### What could be improved:
- The colours aren't great

#### What I focused on:
- Although I do like the original chart, I decided to try something different. It's almost liked an alternative to a standard lollipop chart.
