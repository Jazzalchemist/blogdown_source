[Last week](https://jbraggins.netlify.com/2017/11/analysis-in-excel-part-one) I went over some useful Excel functions in the first of two parts about analysis in Excel. For part two I thought Iâ€™d go over some other tools available within Excel, including some examples of how to use them.

#### Conditional Formatting

Conditional formatting allows you to highlight cells based on certain values or rules. Some examples of this includes highlighting duplicate values, or highlighting values over or under a specified value. Conditional Formatting can be found under the Home tab on the Ribbon. Conditional formatting can be found under the Home tab on the Ribbon.

Example highlighting values greater than 60:



1.  Data before applying conditional formatting

2.  Data after applying conditional formatting to cells A1:A10 (conditional formatting is at the top right of the image)

#### Pivot Tables

Pivot tables are great for summarising a data-set. They are incredibly useful for analysis, and are fairly easy to create. Pivot Tables can be found on the Insert tab on the Ribbon.

Example of pivoting sales by region:



1.  Original sales data

2.  Pivot table summarising sales data by region

#### Charts

Excel charts come in many shapes and sizes, and are useful for visualising a data-set. I'll keep the example below short and simple, but I strongly recommend learning more about charts and data visualisation outside of this post as they are an important component of analytics. Charts can be found under the Insert tab on the Ribbon. 

Example of plotting sales by region:

#### Remove Duplicates

This is a simple but useful tool in Excel. It does exactly what it says on the tin - removes duplicates in your data. As anyone who has done any sort of data cleansing will know, duplicates are one of the more common issues to fix in raw data. Remove duplicates can be found under the Data tab on the Ribbon.  


#### Freeze Panes

Freeze panes is useful for when you want to be able to see column or row names in a data-set. Freeze panes can be found under the View tab on the Ribbon. 

Example of scrolling down without losing column names:

### Conclusion

I hope the tips provided in part one and two of analysis in Excel were useful. I wrote both posts from a "what I would have liked to have known as a new analyst" point-of-view, so they may not be of much benefit to more experienced Excel users. 
I also got a bit of Excel practice done at the same time, which was very handy!  

##### Feel free to ask any questions about either post, or to ask me about anything else Excel-related.
