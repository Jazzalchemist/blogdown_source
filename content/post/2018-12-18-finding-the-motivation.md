It has been a tough few months in the lead up to Christmas. 

I've found my motivation to do, well, anything in data visualisation has severely waned. As a result, I took steps to try and reinvigorate my interest in what I was doing. For example, I started learning Tableau in late July, and shortly after began to post to things to my [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jared.braggins2936#!/) profile. I even started taking part in the #SWDchallenge.

It was fun for awhile.

I needed to learn Tableau for work, but the focus on how and why we were using it was a mystery - there was no clear business goal. With no purpose in why I was trying to learn Tableau, I found myself drifting back towards getting better at Python, and then also back to practicing R as well. I think you can see the problem here!

A scatter gun approach was never going to learn. 

My plan is to take a break over Christmas and reassess things. I'm thinking of going back to basics with R and building back up from there. I'll be studying part-time next year, which will also keep me busy as I slowly chip away at my degree. 

Anyway, here's to a more focussed and productive year in 2019.

Merry Christmas!
