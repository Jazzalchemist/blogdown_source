Week 20 of #MakeoverMonday looked at a very sad topic - rhino poachng in South Africa.

Here's the original viz:

##### What works well:
- Simple but effective colours choices
- Clear title
- The use of rhino imagery helps make it immediately clear what the chart is about


##### What could be improved:
- I didn't like the use of a unit chart as it didn't quite make sense in terms of numbers of poached rhinos per year
- The use of rhino icons seemed a but too 'fun' for such a serious topic

##### What I focused on:
- I wanted to simplify the orginal chart
- I wanted to annotate some of the key facts as well
