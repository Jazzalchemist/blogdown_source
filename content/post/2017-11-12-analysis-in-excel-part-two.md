[Last week](https://jbraggins.netlify.com/2017/11/analysis-in-excel-part-one) I went over some useful Excel functions in the first of two parts about analysis in Excel. For part two I thought Iâ€™d go over some other tools available within Excel, including some examples of how to use them.

#### Conditional Formatting

Conditional formatting allows you to highlight cells based on certain values or rules. Some examples of this includes highlighting duplicate values, or highlighting values over or under a specified value.

Example:

Data before

#### Pivot Tables

Pivot tables are great for summarising a data-set. They are incredibly useful for analysis, and are fairly easy to create.

Example:

#### Charts

Excel charts come in many shapes and sizes, and are useful for visualising a data-set. I'll keep the example below short and simple, but I strongly recommend learning more about charts and data visualisation outside of this post as they are an important component of analytics. 

Example:

#### Remove Duplicates

This is a simple but useful tool in Excel. It does exactly what it says on the tin - removes duplicates in your data. As anyone who has done any sort of data cleansing will know, duplicates are one of the more common issues to fix in raw data.  

Example:

#### Freeze Panes

Freeze panes is useful for when you want to be able to see column or row names in a data-set. 

Example:

### Conclusion

I hope the tips provided in part one and two of analysis in Excel were useful. I wrote both posts from a "what I would have liked to have known as a new analyst" point-of-view, so they may not be of much benefit to more experienced Excel users. 
I also got a bit of Excel practice done at the same time, which was very handy!  

##### Feel free to ask any questions about either post, or to ask me about something else in Excel that hasn't already been covered.
