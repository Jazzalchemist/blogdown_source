      <description>Week 12 of #Makeover Monday looked at the Reykjavik Index Index. Here&amp;rsquo;s the original visualisation:
What works well:  Simple colour scheme It is possible to figure see which countries are above average  What could be improved:  Being a radial chart, it&amp;rsquo;s circular nature makes it much harder to read than a bar chart The chart lacks context for what it is trying to show The G7 average gets a bit lost amongst the countries, despite being a different colour  What I focused on  I wanted to show the data in a bar chart that had supporting commentary.</description>
