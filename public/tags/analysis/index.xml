      <description>Week 20 of #MakeoverMonday looked at a very sad topic - rhino poachng in South Africa.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the original viz:
What works well:  Simple but effective colours choices Clear title The use of rhino imagery helps make it immediately clear what the chart is about  What could be improved:  I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the use of a unit chart as it didn&amp;rsquo;t quite make sense in terms of numbers of poached rhinos per year The use of rhino icons seemed a but too &amp;lsquo;fun&amp;rsquo; for such a serious topic  What I focused on:  I wanted to simplify the orginal chart I wanted to annotate some of the key facts as well  The interactive version can be found here</description>

      <description>Week 19 of #MakeoverMonday looked at the most efficient batters in Major League Baseball (MLB).
Here&amp;rsquo;s the original viz:
What works well:  Simple title that says what it is about Nice colour choices There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of detail included, but without cluttering the viz  What could be improved:  I don&amp;rsquo;t follow baseball, I was a bit lost when trying to understand this I was confused by the highlighted stats.</description>

      <description>The focus of this month&amp;rsquo;s #SWDChallenge was on artisanal data.
I found this challenge to be incredibly enjoyable. Why? Because I got to design a visualisation using data that I knew inside and out (since it was about my work history after all!). But hey, that was kinda the point, right?
I want to take a step back here though. I want to address why I used data about my work history.</description>

      <description>For #TidyTuesday week 18 we looked at bird collisions in Chicago.
The Data The data for week 18 comes from a study conducted by the Royal Society.
The Analysis I wanted to show the number of collisions per bird family over time. This ended up being a perfect excuse to try a ridgeline chart for the first time.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the code:

      <description>Week 18 of #MakeoverMonday looked at spacewalks at the International Space Station.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the original viz:
What works well:  The heading is a succinct summary of what the viz is showing Using the BANS (Big-ass numbers) for USA and Russia as a legend is a good idea The labels on the bars make the chart easier to read The colours are a good choice as they are very close to the NASA palette  What could be improved:  The years on the x-axis are on an angle, making them harder to read There are numerous images on the viz, making it very busy  What I focused on:  Changing the bar chart to a line chart Changing the orientation of the dates on the x-axis to be horizontal Adding the BANs into the description  The interactive version can be found here</description>

      <guid>https://jaredbraggins.com/2019/04/cowboy-bebop-chart/</guid>
      <description>For #TidyTuesday week 17 I got a little too ambitious.
I had decided to focus on my favourite anime, Cowboy Bebop. My original goal was to use gganimate to plot the top 20 anime for each year, but to also include any anime for previous years back to 1998. This was to show a rolling top 20 from the year that Cowboy Bebop was released.
The Data The data for week 17 comes from MyAnimeList.</description>

      <description>Week 17 of #MakeoverMonday looked at Stephen Curry&amp;rsquo;s ranking of stadium popcorn.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the original viz:
What works well:  A heat chart is perfect for this data. The labels and colours work well There&amp;rsquo;s a clear title The scoring is simple  What could be improved:  The colours aren&amp;rsquo;t great  What I focused on:  Although I do like the original chart, I decided to try something different.</description>

      <guid>https://jaredbraggins.com/2019/04/the-economist-data-viz-mistakes/</guid>
      <description>My focus for #TidyTuesday Week 16 was on trying to replicate a chart. For context, the idea was to explore the data behind some before and after charts from the Economist. Here are the charts I was looking at:
Instead of trying to make my own version of the better chart, I decided to try and figure out how to replicate some of the elements in it. Specifically:
 Highlighting points in a scatterplot Label the highlighted points, but to also add custom formatting to some of the labels only  Here&amp;rsquo;s the code:</description>

      <description>Week 16 of #MakeoverMonday was a collaboration with RJ Andrews, and looked at the most common words in his book Info We Trust.
What works well:  The most common word, data, stands out well People are used to seeing and interpreting word clouds  What could be improved:  Lack of a title or description Having words on different angles makes them hard to read Too many colours that don&amp;rsquo;t seem to serve a purpose  What I focused on:  I decided to show the top ten words per section in the book, which highlighted how common the word &amp;lsquo;data&amp;rsquo; is.</description>

      <guid>https://jaredbraggins.com/2019/04/grand-slam-winners/</guid>
      <description>My focus for #TidyTuesday Week 15 was on getting better at exploratory analysis. This is a bit of a contrast to previous weeks where most of my effort has gone into data visualisation.
The Data Week 15&amp;rsquo;s data comes from Wikipedia. Inspiration for this week came from John Burn-Murdoch&amp;rsquo;s amazing article in the Financial Times.
The Analysis I decided to look at the top Grand Slam winners, but I broke this down by court type (grass, clay or hard).</description>

      <description>Week 15 of #MakeoverMonday looked at ranking US states by fiscal condition. Here&amp;rsquo;s the original visualisation:
What works well:  Tidy design Good choice of colours Clear question in the title The top/bottom states are clearly stated  What could be improved:  It isn&amp;rsquo;t clear if things are improving or getting worse. Is this any different to the previous year? More information could be added in the form of text to help explain what is being shown here  What I focused on:  I struggled with this one.</description>

      <title>Live Longer and How to Emulate Your Heroes</title>

      <guid>https://jaredbraggins.com/2019/04/live-longer-and-how-to-emulate-your-heroes/</guid>
      <description>This month&amp;rsquo;s #SWDChallenge was to find a visualisation you like and emulate it. I went with the &amp;lsquo;Live Long&amp;rsquo; chart by David McCandless of Information is Beautiful. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of David&amp;rsquo;s work. His visualisations are stunning. I even own two of his books - Information is Beautiful and Knowledge is Beautiful - which I love to flick through when I&amp;rsquo;m struggling for inspiration.
I decided to emulate the &amp;lsquo;Live Long&amp;rsquo; chart because a) I wanted to make an interactive version in Tableau, and b) I saw how I could apply my own style to it.</description>

      <description>#TidyTuesday Week 14 was a good challenge for me. I wanted to focus on getting better at creating line charts with ggplot2, and I feel like I achieved that goal.
The Data Week 14&amp;rsquo;s data comes from Seattle&amp;rsquo;s open data portal and contains information about bike traffic in Seattle.
The Analysis Since I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to get back up to speed with using R, I decided to keep it simple and focus on a) showing traffic over time, and b) showing which crossing registered the most traffic each year.</description>

      <description>Week 14 of #MakeoverMonday looked at the different types of waste found on UK beaches per 100m. The data comes from a 2017 by the Marine Conservation Society. Here&amp;rsquo;s the original visualisation:
What works well:  Clean layout with minimal colours Clear title and subtitle The icons help improve the design  What could be improved:  The scattered circles make it hard to compare each category What&amp;rsquo;s the bigger story behind this viz?</description>

      <description>This is my post for #TidyTuesday Week 13, which looked at pet names in Seattle.
The Data Week 13&amp;rsquo;s data comes from Seattle&amp;rsquo;s open data portal and contains information about registered pets.
The Analysis Since this was a quick #TidyTuesday this week I decided to visualise the top ten pet names. I highlighted the most popular name in a different colour to help it stand out.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the code:</description>

      <title>How Different Generations Spend</title>

      <guid>https://jaredbraggins.com/2019/03/makeover-monday-week-13-2019-how-different-generations-spend/</guid>
      <description>Week 13 of #MakeoverMonday looked at how different generations are spending their income. Here&amp;rsquo;s the original visualisation:
What works well:  The overall layout is simple and uncluttered Vivid colours help make each category stand out  What could be improved:  The legend could be moved to the top to help make reading the chart easier Each portion of each bar doesn&amp;rsquo;t start from the same place, so it tricky to compare across each age group (although the labels do help with this)  What I focused on:  I simplified the original visualisation by separating each age group and category into separate bar charts.</description>

      <guid>https://jaredbraggins.com/2019/03/tidy-tuesday-week-11-2019-board-game-analysis/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started taking part in #TidyTuesday, a weekly project focused on using tidyverse packages to clean, wrangle, tidy, and plot a new dataset. The big draw card for me is getting better at using R for analysis.
The Data The data for week 11 was all about board games, which comes from the Board Game Geek Database
Analysis I kept it very simple this week. This was mainly due to my R skills slipping over the previous year.</description>
