      <description>This month&amp;rsquo;s #SWDChallenge was to find a visualisation you like and emulate it. I went with the &amp;lsquo;Live Long&amp;rsquo; chart by David McCandless of Information is Beautiful. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of David&amp;rsquo;s work. His visualisations are stunning. I even own two of his books - Information is Beautiful and Knowledge is Beautiful - which I love to flick through when I&amp;rsquo;m struggling for inspiration.
I decided to emulate the &amp;lsquo;Live Long&amp;rsquo; chart because a) I wanted to make an interactive version in Tableau, and b) I saw how I could apply my own style to it.</description>

      <description>After a hiatus of a few months I&amp;rsquo;m back into taking part in the #SWDChallenge!
March&amp;rsquo;s challenge was a collaboration between Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic (Storytelling with Data) and Enrico Bertini (Data Stories podcast). The aim was to visualise a predefined data set and answer the question of &amp;lsquo;who donates?&amp;rsquo;.
The Data The dataset came from AidData
My Approach  Create a one page report that addressed the question Zero in on the highest donators and take a look at how they were contributing  Reflections What worked well?</description>
