      <description>Week 13 of #Makeover Monday looked at how different generations are spending their income. Here&amp;rsquo;s the original visualisation:
What works well:  The overall payout is simple and uncluttered Vivid colours help make each category stand out  What could be improved:  The legend could be moved to the top to help make reading the chart easier Each portion of each bar doesn&amp;rsquo;t start from the same place, so it tricky to compare across each age group (although the labels do help with this)  What I focused on  I simplified the original visualisation by separating each age group and category into separate bar charts.</description>

The Data The data for week 11 was all about board games, which comes from the Board Game Geek Database
Analysis I kept it very simple this week. This was mainly due to my R skills slipping over the previous year.</description>
