Week 16 of #MakeoverMonday was a collaboration with RJ Andrews, and looked at the most common words in his book Info We Trust.

#### What works well:
- The most common word, data, stands out well
- People are used to seeing and interpreting word clouds

#### What could be improved:
- Lack of a title or description
- Having words on different angles makes them hard to read
- Too many colours that don't seem to serve a purpose

#### What I focused on:
- I decided to show the top ten words per section in the book, which highlighted how common the word 'data' is. It was a simple approach, but I did learn a bit about analysing word frequency

#### Bonus!
RJ Andrews replied to my #MakeoverMonday tweet and offered to give me a short critique. I couldn't say no to this, and in fact it made my week to get some feedback from the man himself!
