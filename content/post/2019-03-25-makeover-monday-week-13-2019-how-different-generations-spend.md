Week 13 of #MakeoverMonday looked at how different generations are spending their income. Here's the original visualisation:

#### What works well:
- The overall layout is simple and uncluttered
- Vivid colours help make each category stand out

#### What could be improved:
- The legend could be moved to the top to help make reading the chart easier
- Each portion of each bar doesn't start from the same place, so it tricky to compare across each age group (although the labels do help with this)

#### What I focused on
- I simplified the original visualisation by separating each age group and category into separate bar charts. I highlighted the highest percentage of spend per age group in order to back up my point about millennials spending more at restaurants.
