      <description>The Data Week 13&amp;rsquo;s data comes from Seattle&amp;rsquo;s open data portal and contains information about registered pets.
The Analysis Since this was a quick #TidyTuesday this week I decided to visualise the top ten pet names. I highlighted the most popular name in a different colour to help it stand out.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the code:
 library(tidyverse) seattle_pets &amp;lt;- read.csv(&amp;quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-03-26/seattle_pets.csv&amp;quot;) # Inspect data View(seattle_pets) # Find top ten names for all pets pet_names &amp;lt;- seattle_pets %&amp;gt;% filter(!</description>

      <description>Week 13 of #MakeoverMonday looked at how different generations are spending their income. Here&amp;rsquo;s the original visualisation:
What works well:  The overall layout is simple and uncluttered Vivid colours help make each category stand out  What could be improved:  The legend could be moved to the top to help make reading the chart easier Each portion of each bar doesn&amp;rsquo;t start from the same place, so it tricky to compare across each age group (although the labels do help with this)  What I focused on  I simplified the original visualisation by separating each age group and category into separate bar charts.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started taking part in #TidyTuesday, a weekly project focused on using tidyverse packages to clean, wrangle, tidy, and plot a new dataset. The big draw card for me is getting better at using R for analysis.
The Data The data for week 11 was all about board games, which comes from the Board Game Geek Database
Analysis I kept it very simple this week. This was mainly due to my R skills slipping over the previous year.</description>
