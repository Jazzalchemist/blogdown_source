First of all, I really like how the title says it all - it is indeed a very big book of dashboards.

I first came across it when in a post over at [Storytelling with Data] (http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2017/8/9/recommended-reading-the-big-book-of-dashboards) (one of my favourite sites for data visualisation inspiration). Since I pretty much trust anything that Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic endorses, I thought I'd buy the book. 

I wasn't disappointed.

I've been using this book at work for two to three months now, and I can honestly say that it has helped me more times than I can count when building dashboards. It is incredibly insightful, and dives into some really great best practice tips.

Authors Steve Wexler, Jeffrey Shaffer and Andy Cotgreave have done an outstanding job of explaining what works in real-world dashboards, as well as what they would improve. Plus, the way they articulate why pie-charts aren't all that effective was spot-on! 

If, like me, you build dashboards on a regular basis then I highly recommend buying this book.
