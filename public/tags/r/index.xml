      <description>For #TidyTuesday week 20 we looked at Nobel Prize Laureates.
The Data The data for week 20 can be found on Kaggle.
The Analysis For this week I wanted to continue my focus on creating maps, so I decided to visualise Nobel Prize Laureates by country of origin. For a bit of additional practice I created a boxplot to visualise Nobel Prize Laureates by gender and category.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the code:</description>

      <description>For #TidyTuesday week 19 we looked at global student to teacher ratios.
The Data The data for week 19 comes from the UNESCO Institute of Statistics.
The Analysis For this week I wanted to focus on student to teacher ratios for tertiary education. I wanted to see what this looked like on a gobal scale, so I decided to show this on a map.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the code:
 # Load packages library(tidyverse) library(extrafont) # Import data student_ratio &amp;lt;- readr::read_csv(&amp;quot;https://raw.</description>

      <description>For #TidyTuesday week 18 we looked at bird collisions in Chicago.
The Data The data for week 18 comes from a study conducted by the Royal Society.
The Analysis I wanted to show the number of collisions per bird family over time. This ended up being a perfect excuse to try a ridgeline chart for the first time.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the code:
 # Load libraries library(tidyverse) library(lubridate) library(ggridges) # Import data bird_collisions &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;https://raw.</description>

      <title>Seattle Bike Traffic</title>

      <description>#TidyTuesday Week 14 was a good challenge for me. I wanted to focus on getting better at creating line charts with ggplot2, and I feel like I achieved that goal.
The Data Week 14&amp;rsquo;s data comes from Seattle&amp;rsquo;s open data portal and contains information about bike traffic in Seattle.
The Analysis Since I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to get back up to speed with using R, I decided to keep it simple and focus on a) showing traffic over time, and b) showing which crossing registered the most traffic each year.</description>

      <description>This is my post for #TidyTuesday Week 13, which looked at pet names in Seattle.
The Data Week 13&amp;rsquo;s data comes from Seattle&amp;rsquo;s open data portal and contains information about registered pets.
The Analysis Since this was a quick #TidyTuesday this week I decided to visualise the top ten pet names. I highlighted the most popular name in a different colour to help it stand out.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the code:</description>

      <description>My second week taking part in #TidyTuesday! Let&amp;rsquo;s keep the ball rolling&amp;hellip;
The Data The data for week 12 was all about traffic stops made by US police officers, which comes from the Stanford Open Policing Project
Analysis I wanted to continue focusing on refreshing my ggplot2 skills this week, particularly around the use of using facet_wrap(). My approach to the analysis was to have a look at driver race in terms of number of traffic stops.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started taking part in #TidyTuesday, a weekly project focused on using tidyverse packages to clean, wrangle, tidy, and plot a new dataset. The big draw card for me is getting better at using R for analysis.
The Data The data for week 11 was all about board games, which comes from the Board Game Geek Database
Analysis I kept it very simple this week. This was mainly due to my R skills slipping over the previous year.</description>
