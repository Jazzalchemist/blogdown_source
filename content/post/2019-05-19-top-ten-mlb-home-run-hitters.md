Week 19 of #MakeoverMonday looked at the most efficient batters in Major League Baseball (MLB).

Here's the original viz:

##### What works well:
- Simple title that says what it is about
- Nice colour choices
- There's a lot of detail included, but without cluttering the viz

##### What could be improved:
- I don't follow baseball, I was a bit lost when trying to understand this
- I was confused by the highlighted stats. What do they mean?
- Similarly, why are certain players highlighted by diamonds in the charts?

##### What I focused on:
- I went with a simple top ten bar chart showing the best home-run hitters. This can be filtered by year. Nice and simple!
