Hi there!

First and foremost, welcome to my blog.

This is something that I have wanted to do for a while now, but I always seemed to put it off. 
I've decided to step into the wondrous world of blogging for a few reasons:

1. I enjoy the process of writing, and I have recently missed this creative outlet

2. I've been reading and learning from numerous other bloggers for the past three years, and I thought I'd throw my hat in the ring and see if I can give a little back

3. The process of blogging will ensure that I keep up the momentum for learning new things

Beyond interesting things happening in the analytics community, expect to see posts about coding, craft beer, basketball and general analytics geekery.
